<!--					Click <a href="http://helloworldws-jaysarnawbcalndr.rhcloud.com/jboss-helloworld-ws/HelloWorldService?wsdl">here</a> to see wsdl. -->
				<br> NOTE: This webservice was created and integrated into this application in 2016 when Redhat cloud (Openshift) allowed upto three web applications to be hosted on their free subscription. Now they allow only one application. Therefore, <b>I had take down this webservice (it is no longer operational) and remove the integration with this web calendar application</b>. However, the notes on this page are still valid because they are from 2016 when the webservice was hosted and operational while being integrated with this web application.

								<br>1. Selenium, cucumber running on Eclipse
								<br>2. Openshift account setup with RHC and GIT configuration management tools setup.

							<h5>STEP 1</h5>
								<br> Setup the Web Service using sample, and incorporate web methods in it needed by Web Calendar application. 
								<br> What success meant: A web service wsdl (web service definition used by public to consume the web service's services)publically available that exposes the methods needed in web calendar application.
								<br>
								<br>The image below displays the public interface for the web service that is utilised by the wsdl.

				<br> University of Auckland, Bachelor of Engineering Final year project on Web Services Availability
				<br>--------------
				<br> PROJECT AIM: To develop a Software Framework to Dynamically Reconfigure Web Services to deal with downtime 
				<br>--------------
				<br>
				<br> During my final year at university I co-developed with one partner a software framework for dealing with downtime experienced by web services, both scheduled and unscheduled, with the aim of making remote web services robust. Received <strong>'A' grade</strong> for project. The application developed would monitor the communications with the web service via a proxy and if it noticed an outage, it would in real time switch to another web service, the link to which was stored in an associated database and could be updated via a GUI interface by a privileged user. In case of maintenance related scheduled outages, this GUI could be used to initiate the switch to a standby web service by user. For unscheduled outages, we came up with two algorithms to implement the proxy’s response, a “pro-active” one and a “re-active” one. The “pro-active” one would use pings to determine the health of the web service and if noticing an outage, it would switch web services in real time. The “re-active” one would use as a trigger, an outage related exception generated by the web service in response to a valid request due to unforeseen outage, to perform the switch.
